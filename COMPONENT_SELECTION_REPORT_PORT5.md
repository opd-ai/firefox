## Selected Component: **IsFloat32Representable** (mfbt/FloatingPoint.cpp)

**Decision Rationale:**

IsFloat32Representable scores highest (34/40) and represents an ideal candidate for Port #5:

1. **Simplicity** (9/10): Only 42 lines of pure computation with minimal dependencies
2. **Stability** (10/10): Extremely stable - only 1 commit in the last year
3. **Clear Semantics**: Single function that checks if a double can be represented as float32
4. **Testability**: Used extensively in JavaScript engine (29 call sites), providing implicit validation
5. **Zero Platform Dependencies**: Pure C++ math - no platform-specific code
6. **Logical Progression**: Follows the pattern of previous ports (pure functions, mathematical operations)

**Comparison to Previous Ports:**
- Port #1 (Dafsa): Data structure - more complex
- Port #2 (ChaosMode): Static methods with atomics
- Port #3 (XorShift128PlusRNG): Stateful PRNG algorithm
- Port #4 (HashBytes): Pure function, byte processing
- **Port #5 (IsFloat32Representable)**: Pure function, floating point check ✅

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Factors:
- ✅ Pure computation (no side effects)
- ✅ Simple function signature: `bool IsFloat32Representable(double aValue)`
- ✅ No platform-specific code
- ✅ Minimal dependencies (std lib only)
- ✅ Very stable (1 commit/year)
- ✅ Clear success criteria (mathematical correctness)

### Medium Risk Factors:
- ⚠️ 29 call sites (more than previous ports, but manageable)
- ⚠️ No dedicated test file (need to create comprehensive tests)
- ⚠️ Floating point precision must be exact

### Mitigation Strategies:
1. **For 29 call sites**: FFI layer will be simple (single function, no state)
2. **For test coverage**: Create comprehensive Rust tests covering:
   - Exact representable values (1.0, 2.5, etc.)
   - Values exceeding float32 range (±FLT_MAX)
   - NaN and infinity cases
   - Edge cases (denormals, zero, negative zero)
   - Values between adjacent float32 values
3. **For floating point precision**: Use Rust's built-in f32/f64 types with standard casting

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 2: Analysis
- Document IsFloat32Representable API
- Map 29 call sites
- Analyze FloatingPoint.h for related functions
- Create comprehensive test plan

### Phase 3: Implementation
- Implement in Rust using f32/f64 standard types
- Create FFI wrapper with #[no_mangle]
- Add comprehensive tests (30+ test cases)
- Ensure bit-exact behavior matches C++

### Phase 4: Integration
- Create local/mozconfig.rust-floatingpoint
- Update local/moz.build
- Add to Cargo workspace
- Create build overlay

### Phase 5: Validation
- Test all 29 call sites with Rust implementation
- Verify mathematical correctness
- Performance comparison (should be identical)
- Zero-conflict upstream merge test

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours (simple pure function)  
**Risk Level**: **Low** (pure math, well-defined semantics)

## Alternate Candidates for Future Ports

### Queue Position #2: IsValidUtf8 (mfbt/Utf8.cpp)
- Score: 31/40
- Rationale: Excellent candidate, but only active in non-JSRUST builds
- Estimated effort: 3-4 hours
- Risk: Low-Medium (MOZ_PRETEND_NO_JSRUST dependency)

### Queue Position #3: IncrementalTokenizer (xpcom/ds/)
- Score: 25/40
- Rationale: More complex, requires deeper analysis
- Estimated effort: 6-8 hours
- Risk: Medium (stateful logic, unknown test coverage)

## Selection Verification

- ✅ Component NOT already in CARCINIZE.md
- ✅ Component is NOT a test file (production code)
- ✅ Score ≥ 25/40 (minimum threshold: 34/40 achieved)
- ✅ Single, well-defined API surface
- ✅ Measurable success criteria
- ✅ Fits overlay architecture pattern

**APPROVED FOR PORT #5** ✅
