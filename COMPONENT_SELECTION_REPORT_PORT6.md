# Component Selection Report - Port #6

## Selected Component: IsValidUtf8

**Location**: mfbt/Utf8.cpp → local/rust/firefox_utf8_validator/
**Type**: Production code (NOT test file) ✓
**Selection Score**: 34/40

### Scoring Breakdown

#### Simplicity: 8/10
- Lines of code: 40 (<200 lines = 10/10)
- Dependencies: 3 (Maybe.h, TextUtils.h, Utf8.h = 10/10)
- Platform-specific code: None (10/10)
- BUT: Depends on DecodeOneUtf8CodePoint template (complex, reduces to 8/10)

#### Isolation: 10/10
- Call sites: 1 (public wrapper in Utf8.h = 10/10)
- Header dependencies: 3 (10/10)
- Inheritance depth: 0 (10/10)

#### Stability: 10/10
- Commits last year: 1 (10/10)
- Bug references: 0 (10/10)
- Last major refactor: >2 years (10/10)

#### Testability: 6/10
- Test coverage: Comprehensive C++ tests in TestUtf8.cpp (10/10)
- Test types: Unit tests only (4/10)
- Test clarity: Clear assertions (10/10)
- Average = 8/10, reduced to 6/10 for single test type

### Rationale

IsValidUtf8 is the optimal Port #6 because:

1. **Pure Computation**: Validates UTF-8 byte sequences with no I/O or side effects
2. **Excellent Isolation**: Only 1 call site (public API wrapper)
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: 17 test assertions covering all edge cases
4. **High Stability**: 1 commit in last year, mature code
5. **Clear API Boundary**: Single function: `bool IsValidUtf8(const void*, size_t)`
6. **Rust Strength**: UTF-8 validation is perfect for Rust's safe string handling
7. **Pattern Continuity**: Similar to previous ports (pure functions)

### Implementation Strategy

**Chosen Approach**: Leverage Rust's built-in UTF-8 validation
- Use `std::str::from_utf8()` (highly optimized, correct)
- Wrap in FFI-safe function with same signature as C++
- Validates against same UTF-8 standard (RFC 3629)

**Alternative Rejected**: Port DecodeOneUtf8CodePoint logic
- Would be more complex and error-prone
- Rust stdlib is battle-tested and may be faster (SIMD)

### Risk Assessment

**Low Risk Factors**:
- Single function, clear API boundary
- Pure computation (no state, no I/O)
- Comprehensive test coverage (17 C++ + 27 Rust tests)
- Only 1 call site to update
- No platform dependencies
- Well-established algorithm (UTF-8 validation)

**Medium Risk Factors** (all mitigated):
- UTF-8 edge cases → Rust stdlib handles correctly
- Performance critical → Rust stdlib is highly optimized (SIMD)

**High Risk Factors**: None

### Candidates Rejected

1. **Poison.cpp**: Too much platform-specific code (Windows, Linux, OS/2)
2. **TaggedAnonymousMemory.cpp**: Linux-only (not cross-platform)
3. **RandomNum.cpp**: Extensive platform-specific random generation code

## Decision

✅ **APPROVED**: Proceed with porting IsValidUtf8 (mfbt/Utf8.cpp)

**Total Score**: 34/40 (exceeds 25/40 threshold) ✓
**Production Code**: Yes (not a test file) ✓
**Ready for Phase 2**: Analysis ✓
