- **Test Coverage**: 16 Rust tests (10 unit + 6 integration)
- **Selection Score**: 34/40
  - Simplicity: 10/10 (112 lines, 3 deps, no platform code)
  - Isolation: 10/10 (18 call sites, 3 header deps, no inheritance)
  - Stability: 10/10 (1 commit/year, very stable)
  - Testability: 4/10 (no explicit C++ tests, but easily testable)
- **Rationale**: ChaosMode is a testing infrastructure component with static methods only, minimal dependencies, and excellent isolation. Perfect for demonstrating atomic operations and static dispatch in Rust.
- **Challenges**:
  - Handling atomic memory ordering (Relaxed) correctly
  - Using C's rand() for compatibility (intentionally not thread-safe)
  - Supporting arbitrary bit flag combinations in FFI
- **Performance**: Expected neutral (simple atomic ops)
- **Upstream Impact**: Zero conflicts maintained - reuses existing local/ infrastructure
- **Call Sites**: 34 calls across 11 files (DOM, networking, threading, timers, testing)

### 3. XorShift128PlusRNG ✅
- **Date**: 2025-10-19
- **Location**: mfbt/XorShift128PlusRNG.h → local/rust/firefox_xorshift128plus/
- **C++ Lines**: 122 (header-only)
- **Rust Lines**: 833 (lib.rs + ffi.rs + tests.rs + README.md)
- **Test Coverage**: 4 C++ test functions (remain in C++, call via FFI) + 10 Rust tests
- **Selection Score**: 36/40
  - Simplicity: 10/10 (122 lines, 4 deps, no platform code)
  - Isolation: 9/10 (22 call sites, 4 header deps, no inheritance)
  - Stability: 10/10 (1 commit/year, very stable)
  - Testability: 7/10 (comprehensive C++ tests, algorithmic validation)
- **Rationale**: XorShift128+ is a well-documented, mathematically-proven PRNG with minimal dependencies and excellent isolation. Pure computation with no I/O or platform dependencies - perfect for demonstrating Rust's zero-cost abstractions in low-level bit manipulation.
- **Challenges**:
  - JIT integration: offsetOfState0/1 methods used by JIT for direct memory access
  - Struct layout: Must guarantee #[repr(C)] matches C++ exactly (16 bytes)
  - Bit-exact arithmetic: XOR, shift, wrapping_add must match C++ perfectly
  - Double precision: nextDouble() must use exact 53-bit mantissa extraction
  - Performance: Used in Math.random() JIT compilation (critical path)
- **Solutions**:
  - Used #[repr(C)] for guaranteed memory layout
  - Compile-time assertions verify struct size and offsets
  - Wrapping arithmetic matches C++ unsigned overflow semantics
  - FFI layer catches panics to prevent unwinding into C++
  - Comprehensive tests validate bit-exact algorithm implementation
- **Performance**: Target ~1-2 CPU cycles per call (from academic paper), Rust should match via inlining
- **Upstream Impact**: Zero conflicts maintained - reuses existing local/ infrastructure
- **Call Sites**: 54 references across 18 files (primarily JS engine JIT, memory allocator, privacy/fingerprinting resistance)

### 4. HashBytes ✅
- **Date**: 2025-10-19
- **Location**: mfbt/HashFunctions.cpp → local/rust/firefox_hashbytes/
- **C++ Production Lines Removed**: 38 (.cpp)
- **C++ Test Lines (unchanged)**: 0 (indirectly tested via hash tables)
- **Rust Lines Added**: 575 (lib.rs + ffi.rs + tests.rs + README.md)
- **Test Coverage**: 29 Rust tests (100% pass rate) - No C++ tests, indirectly validated
- **Tests Ported**: NONE (no dedicated C++ tests exist, testing via integration)
- **Selection Score**: 35/40
  - Simplicity: 10/10 (38 lines, 3 deps, no platform code)
  - Isolation: 8/10 (~29 call sites, 3 header deps, no inheritance)
  - Stability: 10/10 (1 commit/year, very stable)
  - Testability: 7/10 (indirectly tested via hash tables, ~60% coverage)
- **Rationale**: HashBytes is a pure computation function that hashes byte arrays using golden ratio mixing (Fibonacci hashing, Knuth TAOCP 6.4). Single function, no I/O, no platform dependencies, clear API boundary - perfect for demonstrating Rust's raw pointer handling and word-aligned memory access optimization while maintaining zero-cost abstractions.
- **Challenges**:
  - Performance-critical: Used in JIT compiler (js/src/jit/) for code cache keys (hot path)
  - Word-by-word processing: Must optimize memory access (8 bytes/iteration on 64-bit)
  - Unaligned memory: Must handle unaligned loads safely and efficiently
  - ~29 call sites: Used across graphics (gfx/), JS engine (js/src/), media (dom/media/)
- **Solutions**:
  - Aggressive inlining (#[inline(always)]) for hot path optimization
  - Word-by-word processing via ptr::read_unaligned for performance
  - Comprehensive tests: 29 tests covering determinism, avalanche effect, boundary conditions
  - Panic-safe FFI layer with null pointer checks and fallback handling
  - Zero unsafe violations: All unsafe blocks documented with safety invariants

- **Call Sites**: ~29 across Firefox codebase
  - Graphics: Font cache, blur effects, 2D rendering (gfx/)
  - JS Engine: JIT code cache, stencil hashing, BigInt (js/src/)
  - Other: Media logging, border cache, memory profiling
- **FFI Design**: Panic-catching wrapper prevents unwinding into C++, null-safe, zero-length-safe
- **Algorithm**: Golden ratio (0x9E3779B9) hash mixing with 5-bit rotation

### 5. IsFloat32Representable ✅
- **Date**: 2025-10-19
- **Location**: mfbt/FloatingPoint.cpp → local/rust/firefox_floatingpoint/
- **C++ Production Lines Removed**: 42 (.cpp)
- **C++ Test Lines (unchanged)**: 19 test assertions (mfbt/tests/TestFloatingPoint.cpp)
- **Rust Lines Added**: 675 (lib.rs + ffi.rs + README.md + build files)
- **Test Coverage**: 30+ Rust tests (19 test functions) + 2 doc tests = 100% pass rate
- **Tests Ported**: NONE (tests remain in C++, calling via FFI)
- **Selection Score**: 34/40
  - Simplicity: 9/10 (42 lines, 3 deps, no platform code)
  - Isolation: 8/10 (6 call sites - all JIT, 3 header deps, no inheritance)
  - Stability: 10/10 (1 commit/year, very stable)
  - Testability: 7/10 (comprehensive C++ tests, ~85% coverage)
- **Rationale**: IsFloat32Representable is a pure computation function that checks if a double-precision float can be losslessly represented as float32 using IEEE-754 round-trip testing. Single function, no I/O, no platform dependencies, clear mathematical semantics - perfect for demonstrating Rust's floating point handling while maintaining zero-cost abstractions.
- **Challenges**:
  - Floating point edge cases: NaN, ±∞, ±0, denormals require careful handling
  - IEEE-754 compliance: Must match C++ behavior exactly for all special values
  - JIT integration: Used in 6 call sites in JavaScript JIT compiler (performance-sensitive)
  - Test coverage: No dedicated test file initially (needed comprehensive test creation)
- **Solutions**:
  - Comprehensive test suite: 30+ test cases covering all edge cases (zeroes, NaN, infinity, denormals, overflow, underflow, precision loss)
  - Rust's built-in f32/f64 types are IEEE-754 compliant (same standard as C++)
  - Round-trip conversion test: `(value as f32) as f64 == value` detects precision loss elegantly
  - FFI panic boundary: `catch_unwind` prevents unwinding into C++ (defense-in-depth)
  - Inline optimization: `#[inline]` ensures no performance overhead
- **Performance**: Expected 100-105% (identical IEEE-754 operations, same CPU instructions)
- **Upstream Impact**: Zero conflicts maintained - changes in local/ + 2 minimal conditional lines
- **Call Sites**: 6 across Firefox codebase (all in JIT compiler):
  - js/src/jit/MIR-wasm.cpp:764 - WebAssembly JIT optimization (double→float32)
  - js/src/jit/MIR.cpp:1159 - Float32 constant validation (assertion)
  - js/src/jit/MIR.cpp:1429 - Int32→float32 representability check
  - js/src/jit/MIR.cpp:1432 - Double→float32 representability check

## Architecture Notes

### Overlay Strategy
All Rust ports use the zero-conflict overlay architecture:
- Rust code in local/rust/
- Build overlays in local/moz.build
- Compile-time switching via --enable-rust-<component>
- Maximum 3 lines added to upstream moz.build (include statement)

### Testing Protocol
Every port must:
- ✅ Pass 100% of existing tests
- ✅ Maintain performance within ±5%
- ✅ Build cleanly with git pull upstream/main
- ✅ Coexist with C++ version via compile flag

### Lessons Learned

  - Intentionally preserving non-thread-safe rand() required FFI to libc
- **Solutions**:
  - Use raw u32 in FFI layer, bitwise operations for feature checking
